% basicDoorKey
%
% Controlls the behaviour of a door and the group of
% keys that available to open it.
%
% Initialization
%--------------------
%  basicDoorKey(init, OID, ON_OPEN, KEYLIST)
%   OID: Identifier of the door object
%   ON_OPEN: List of actions to do when door is open. They 
%		could be any pl-man actions
%   KEYLIST: List of OIDs of keys that can open the door
%
% Example
%--------------------
% createGameEntity(OID_D, '/', object, 1, 4, inactive, norule, 
%                 data(puerta, solid, static, norule, 'Puerta que se abre con la llave azul')), 
% createGameEntity(OID_A, '-', object, 8, 5, inactive, norule, 
%                 data(llave_azul, not_solid, not_static, basicDoorKey, 'Llave Azul')),
% basicDoorKey(init, OID_D, 
%	['pl-man':destroyGameEntity(OID_D), 'pl-man':destroyGameEntity(OID_A)], [OID_A]).
%
% Creates a door that can only be opened with 'llave_azul'.
% The door and the key simply vanish when the door is opened.
