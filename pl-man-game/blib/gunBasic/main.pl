% gunBasic
%
% Controlls the behaviour of a gun which can be got and
% shot.
%
% Initialization
%--------------------
%  gunBasic(init, OID, AMMO, AIMLIST, AMMO_END)
%   OID: Object ID of the object to be controlled
%   AMMO: Number of shots the gun comes with
%   AIMLIST: List of objects the gun can hit at
%   AMMO_END: What to do when the gun runs out of ammo
%		(destroy, keep).
%
% Example
%--------------------
% createGameEntity(OID, '¬', object, 6, 5, inactive, norule, 
%                 data(pistola, not_solid, not_static, gunBasic, 'Derringer')),
% gunBasic(init, OID, 1, ['E'], destroy).
%
% Creates a gun with 1 shot of ammo, which is only capable
% of killing enemies ('E'). This gun will disappear (i.e.
% it will autodestroy itself) once shot.
